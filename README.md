# Beluga
1. Created a sensor board for Beluga robotics platform
2. Contains PCB, Arduino Code

## Project description
A biosensor designed for microbial auditing, which is mounted onboard an autonomous robot as a payload. The PCB in this sensor helps to initiate helps to reduce the streamline the electronics due to space constraints to initiate the sampling sequence / processes of the biosensor.

### V1
